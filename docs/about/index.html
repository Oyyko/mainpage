    <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
    <p>My academic journey in computer science began at the prestigious <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a>, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in 2023. Eager to expand my horizons, I embarked on the next chapter of my education at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a> in September 2023. Here, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science, with an anticipated graduation in March 2025. The summer of 2024 saw me applying my skills as an intern at TikTok in San Jose, California, bridging the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application.</p>

    <h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
    <p>My passion lies in computer systems and infrastructure technology. I've developed a strong foundation in Operating Systems, Compiler Design, Linux Kernel, C++ Performance Optimization, and Assembly Language. This expertise has been honed through various professional experiences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Summer 2022: Interned with TikTok's <a href="https://www.larksuite.com/en_us">Lark</a> team, where I contributed to developing screenshot and video recording functionalities based on the open-source <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/">Chromium</a> project.</li>
      <li>Early 2023: Engaged in a remote internship with <a href="https://www.suger.io/">Suger.io</a>, a SaaS-focused startup, where I leveraged Go for backend development and business logic implementation.</li>
      <li>Summer 2024: Returned to TikTok, this time focusing on optimizing the performance of <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protobuf</a>, further deepening my expertise in efficient data serialization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
    <p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm deeply committed to the open-source community. I've made significant contributions to <a href="https://github.com/XmacsLabs/mogan">GNU TeXmacs (Mogan)</a>, and I'm excited about future opportunities to contribute to projects like Protobuf and Chromium.</p>

    <h2>C++ Mastery</h2>
    <p>Throughout my development career, C++ has been my language of choice, captivating me with its power and complexity. I've immersed myself in numerous books and technical blogs to master its intricacies, and I'm currently exploring the cutting-edge features of the C++20 standard. While C++ holds a special place in my toolkit, I'm also proficient in Haskell, Lisp, Python, Rust, Java, TypeScript, and other languages. For me, the journey of learning programming languages is an endless source of fascination and growth.</p>

    <p>For those looking to deepen their C++ expertise, I highly recommend the following seminal works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"A Tour of C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup</li>
      <li>"The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup</li>
      <li>"The Design and Evolution of C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup</li>
      <li>"C++ Concurrency in Action" by Anthony Williams</li>
      <li>"C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo</li>
      <li>"Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers</li>
      <li>"Effective C++" by Scott Meyers</li>
      <li>"Professional C++" by Marc Gregoire</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These works have been instrumental in shaping my understanding and appreciation of C++, and I believe they offer invaluable insights for any serious C++ developer.</p>
